a feedback form is an essential tool to collect feedback from participants. The feedback form we have created has the capability to add screenshots and use the hover feature to highlight specific areas of the competition that participants are having trouble with. This will help the organizers to quickly identify and address the issues.
The significance of the feedback form is that it will provide a centralized location for participants to report issues and provide feedback. This will make it easier for organizers to track and manage the feedback. Additionally, the ability to add screenshots and use the hover feature will make it easier for participants to explain their issues, which will help organizers to quickly identify and address the issues. .
